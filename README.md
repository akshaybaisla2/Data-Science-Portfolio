- **Python Web scrapping project with deployment**
  - [Review Scrapper](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Review-Scrapper): This Project is intended to create a web scraper. In this case, a review scrapper is used for extracting reviews from an e-commerce website and then deploying it to the Heroku cloud platform. This project takes a simple example of an online cell phone purchase and tries to create a review scrapper.<br>
    - *Final Output: <http://reviewscrapper-brave-rabbit-ms.cfapps.io>*<br>
Click on the upper link for checking the final output of the project- search any cellphone name/ brand in the search bar and my program will return all the reviews related to that cellphone after scraping the same from internet.<br>
  - [Image Scraper]()
  
 *Tools:Flask,Heroku,Python Libraries-BeautifulSoup,urllib,Requests,Git*

- **Capstone Machine learning Projects**




- **Capstone Deep learning Projects**
  -[Dog Cat Convolution Neural Network Classifier]():
In this project we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images.Here, I use Keras, an high level neural network Library for classify Dog vs cat images from kaggle data-set. 
  - *Final output: flask app link: <https://catdogclassifier-responsive-pangolin-wl.cfapps.io/->*<br>
  Click on the upper link for checking the final output of the project. Upload image of dog or cat and my model try to classify them correctly.
  
  *Tools:Flask,Pivotal,Keras,tensorflow,numpy,Scipy
