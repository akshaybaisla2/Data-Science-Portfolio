- **Python Web scrapping project with deployment**
  - [Review Scrapper](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Review-Scrapper): This Project is intended to create a web scraper. In this case, a review scrapper is used for extracting reviews from an e-commerce website and then deploying it to the Heroku cloud platform. This project takes a simple example of an online cell phone purchase and tries to create a review scrapper.<br>
    - *Final Output: <https://reviewscrapper-fantastic-raven-rj.cfapps.io/>*<br>
Click on the upper link for checking the final output of the project- search any cellphone name/ brand in the search bar and it will return all the reviews related to that cellphone after scraping the same from internet.<br>
	- *step by step explanation: <https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Review-Scrapper/blob/master/ReviewScrapper.pdf>*
  
  
 *Tools:Flask,Pivotal,Python Libraries-BeautifulSoup,urllib,Requests,Git*
 
- **End to End Machine learning Projects with deployment**
  - [Salary prediction](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Salary_Prediction): A simple Salary Prediction model based on Experience, Test score and Interview score deployed on Heroku cloud platform.<br>  
    - *Final output: <https://salary-prediction-dep.herokuapp.com/>*<br>
Enter the required fields to get salary prediction<br>
	
  - [Thyroid detection](): *Note: currently working on this project*

- **Machine Learning projects**
  - [Bikes-rental](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Bikes-rental/blob/master/bikes.ipynb):Problem Statement- Bike-sharing system are meant to rent the bicycle and return to the different place for the bike sharing purpose in Washington DC. You are provided with rental data spanning for 2 years. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.
  - [Black Friday Sales Prediction](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Black-friday-sale-prediction/blob/master/black%20friday%20prediction.ipynb): Build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create a personalized offer for customers against different products.
  - [Cristiano Ronaldo goals dataset eda](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Cristiano-Ronaldo-goals-dataset/blob/master/CristianoRonaldo.ipynb): Dataset of Cristiano Ronaldo’s attempts on the goal target, in his all recorded & unrecorded matches, predict if he has scored a goal or not .
  - [Employee Absenteeism](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/employee_Absenteeism): Employee Absenteeism at work analysis and prediction using Python, MYSQL, Tableau
  

*Tools: Python, MySQL, Tableau,,numpy,scipy,scikit-learn,matplotlib,pandas*



- **End to End Deep learning Projects with deployment**
    - [Dog Cat Convolution Neural Network Classifier]():
In this project we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images.Here, I use Keras, an high level neural network Library for classify Dog vs cat images from kaggle data-set. 
        - *Final output: <https://catdogclassifier-responsive-pangolin-wl.cfapps.io/>*<br>
  Click on the upper link for checking the final output of the project. Upload image of dog or cat and my model try to classify them correctly.
  
  *Tools:Flask,Pivotal,Keras,tensorflow,numpy,Scipy*
  
 - **Deep learning projetcs**
    - [Car Brand Classification using keras](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Transfer-learning-car-classification/blob/master/Transfer%20Learning%20Resnet%2050.ipynb): classify car brands with the help of Transfer Learning VGG 16 and VGG 19 using Keras.
 
  


- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - [Sms Spam Classifier](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/SmsSpamClassifier/blob/master/Sms_Spam_Classifier%20(1).ipynb): Predicting whether an SMS is a spam or ham, SMS are tagged accordingly- ham for legitimate and spam for spam messages.
  - **Sentiment analysis- *Note- currently working on the project***


*Tools: nltk,spacy,word2vec*
	 

- **Data Analysis and Visualisation**
  - [Air Quality data analysis](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Air-Quality-data-analysis): Analyze the air quality data of my own country to find some underlying principles or patterns which might give me an insight into how severe the problem is.
  - [Real time pollution analysis](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Real-time-pollution-analysis-): This project is based on analyzing air quality information of INDIA(AQI, major pollutants) using python.
   - [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Titanic-Dataset---Exploratory-Analysis/blob/master/Titanic%20.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers on board RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualizations.
  - [Thyroid Detection](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Eda_thyroid-dataset/blob/master/thyroidDetection-checkpoint.ipynb): EDA on thyroid detection dataset insights from this eda are later used to build a classification methodology to predict the type of Thyroid based on training data.
