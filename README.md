- **Python Web scrapping project with deployment**
  - [Review Scrapper](https://github.com/akshaybaisla2/Review-Scrapper):This Project is intended to create a web scraper. In this case, a review scrapper is used for extracting reviews from an e-commerce website and then deploying it to the Heroku cloud platform. This project takes a simple example of an online cell phone purchase and tries to create a review scrapper.
  Final Output:<http://reviewscrapper-brave-rabbit-ms.cfapps.io>

Click on upper link for checking final output of the project- search any cellphone name/ brand in the search bar and my program will return all the reviews related to that cellphone after scraping the same from internet.
